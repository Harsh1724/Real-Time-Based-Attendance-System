The AI-based attendance system uses facial recognition to automatically mark attendance through a webcam. Student details and images are stored in Firebase, and their facial features are encoded for identification. When a studentâ€™s face is detected, the system updates their attendance in real time and displays their information on the screen, ensuring quick, contactless, and accurate attendance tracking.
